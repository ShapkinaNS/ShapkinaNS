### Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here's a little bit about me:ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working at DPD. 

In 2010, I joined the company as an economist, and now I hold the position of Head of the Budgeting and Corporate Reporting Department. I have obtained a CMA certificate and have completed courses in Power BI, Python and SQL. Additionally, I actively participated in the integration of DPD and SPSP from the financial perspective.

I'm the Undercover Economist (or Financial Analyst) Â© Ð¢. Harford

I'm a passionate Data explorer for the last 13 years and I'm still learning to collect and analyze the Data even better (Excel, Power BI, Python, SQL)

I really enjoy Statistics and financial modelling as they are truly beautiful.

I'm not afraid of the strictest deadlines, especially when your office is in the process of moving from the north to the center of Moscow on the same day as the deadline :)).

I believe that finding a career that aligns with your passions and interests will truly excel you and make a positive impact in your professional life.


On my GitHub, you will find a collection of my personal projects that I have created during my time at Yandex.Practicum.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me with any questions or collaboration ideas. 

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
