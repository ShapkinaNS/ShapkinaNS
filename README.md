### Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here's a little bit about me:ðŸ‘‹

I'm the Undercover Economist (or Financial Analyst) Â© Ð¢. Harford

I'm a passionate Data explorer for the last 13 years and I'm still learning to collect and analyze the Data even better (Excel, Power BI, Python, SQL)

I really enjoy Statistics and financial modelling as they are truly beautiful.

I'm not afraid of the strictest deadlines, especially when your office is in the process of moving from the north to the center of Moscow on the same day as the deadline :)).

I believe that finding a career that aligns with your passions and interests will truly excel you and make a positive impact in your professional life.
